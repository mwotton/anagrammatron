anagrammatron
=============

this little finger exercise was inspired by an old
[mate](http://www.jboy.id.au/). It isn't really a fair comparison -
while Jimmy's version took 60s to find all the name-anagrams for
"jimmy boyden", it was using a completely different algorithm, so my
test result of 0.06s should not be used as evidence that Haskell is
better than Python.

Haskell being better than Python should be self-evident.
